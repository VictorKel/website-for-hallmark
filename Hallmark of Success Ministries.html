    <p style="font-size:24px;">As part of Basola’s contribution to ameliorate the plight of people affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Basola distributed foodstuffs, health care materials and relief items to families, street boys, and women and continues to do so as the world gradually adjusts to the new normal.
    It is interesting to note that Valentine’s Day is a date thousands of widows in Akute, Ogun State will never forget. A day Dr Basola in conjunction with his partners organizes Valentine widows party where he celebrates widows and gifts them countless food items, clothes and welfare materials. 
    Now in its 3rd year, plans are underway to roll this annual event into a grant scheme for the financial empowerment of widows, single mothers and disadvantaged women.</p>
      
    <p>Rev Basola has been featured on several media platforms including; TVC News, Legit TV, iBrand TV, Wazobia Max, NewsBustang TV, Prayer Parliament TV, LTV 8, Radio Nigeria 101.5FM, NTA Channel 10, EBS, CORETV News, Guardian Newspapers, The Nation Newspapers, Pointer Newspapers and The Sun Newspapers where he speaks and writes on the subject he is widely known for. 
    In recognition of his developmental strides towards nation building, he was recently given an Honourary Doctorate degree by Light of Faith Theological Seminary Nigeria chaired by Professor Emmanuel Shekarau Dangana and a MAN OF HOPE EXCELLENCE AWARD by The Nigerian Christian Journalists Forum, Abuja.
    He is married to his campus Heartthrob, Grace Basola, a child specialist and counselor; their marriage is blessed with two prophetic children and together they serve as the senior pastors of the fast growing Hallmark of Success Ministries, International.</p>
