    <p>Dr Basola is the founder of Kingston Nursery and Primary School, an absolutely free school established to give children from low income families and underserved communities access to FREE AND QUALITY EDUCATION. 
    With the pilot school in Akute, Ogun State, Nigeria, it is noteworthy that students of Kingston Nursery and Primary School receive Free Textbooks, Free Notebooks, Free Set Of Uniforms, and One Meal A Day and this does not reduce the standard of education albeit an absolutely free school.
    In order to attract the best teachers and to honour the dignity and impact of teachers, Basola ensures that the teachers are paid a salary of N50,000 which is far above what is obtainable within and around the community. 
    This is because Basola believes that if teachers are well paid, the teaching profession will attract better qualified candidates which will reflect in the quality of students. 
    To wake up their entrepreneurial abilities and widen their opportunities, the students of Kingston Nursery and Primary School are taught the French Language, Chinese Language and are trained weekly in several personal development and skill acquisition classes.</p>


    <p>As part of Basola’s contribution to ameliorate the plight of people affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Basola distributed foodstuffs, health care materials and relief items to families, street boys, and women and continues to do so as the world gradually adjusts to the new normal.</p>
